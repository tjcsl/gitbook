# Runbooks

We maintain various guides and pieces of documentation in our [Runbooks](https://gitlab.tjhsst.edu/sysadmins/infrastructure/runbooks).

Runbooks aim to be a quick guide of what to do when an incident arrives.  This project is inspired (and heavily borrowed) from [Gitlab's On Call Run Books](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/tree/master).

In addition, this project provides guides, how-tos, and other documentation to perform actions, diagnose anomalies/problems, and prevent problems.  More general architectural documentation should be directed to [https://docs.tjhsst.edu](https://docs.tjhsst.edu).

The maintainer of this project is the [Documentation Lead](https://documentation.tjhsst.edu/general/sysadmins-list#current-leads) under the supervision of the Infrastructure Lead.
