# Documentation

## Overview

Documentation in the Computer Systems Lab is done through GitBook.

Writing good documentation is key to ensuring that knowledge can continue to be passed onto future SysAdmins.

## Organization

The CSL's documentation is organized into five main sections:

* Services: User-facing services
* Technologies: Technologies used by the Lab and SysAdmins
* Servers: Various servers used by the Lab
* General: Anything that doesn't fall under another section
* Procedures: Various procedures

## Contributing

There are two ways to contribute to the GitBook documentation:

* tjcsl.gitbook.io
  * This is the preferred  Ask a GitBook admin for an invite link on Slack if you don't have one.
* GitHub

  * You can open up a pull request to change the documentation.  It will be synced to GitBook once it is merged into master.

In the GitBook web editor, use `Ctrl+/` to display various commands.  Read the GitBook article for more info.

In the GitHub repo, make commits as you work in Markdown.

## Writing Good Documentation

Here are a few pieces of advice to writing good documentation:

* Assume readers know nothing.
  * Documentation will most likely be used much later.  If you talk about items that future readers' don't know about, they won't be able to understand your documentation.
* Simple is better than overly complex. 
  * Using complex terminology and straying too much off topic leaves readers perplexed.  Simple explainations are just better.
* Keep it organized.
  * Use headers to keep relevant topics.  Also remember to write docs in the write docs.  Good organization makes it easier to find the information that matters the most. 
* Document what you had wanted to know.
  * When you started interacting/working in a certain area, what pieces of information would you want to know?  Documentation is constantly evolving and needs to be updated to keep up with the latest changes in the Lab.
