# Borg

Pertinent things to know:

* We have 40 (`borg[01-40]`), but can only run 12 (`borg[01-12]`)
* They are named after constellations or, in rare cases, `borgw[01-40]`
* They run the same OS ([Ubuntu Server](../../technologies/operating-systems/ubuntu-server.md)) and use the same [Ansible](../../technologies/tools/ansible.md) play as the rest of the cluster.
