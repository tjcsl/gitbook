# Ion

Ion \([https://ion.tjhsst.edu](https://ion.tjhsst.edu)\) is the next-generation Intranet system used at TJHSST.  Using Python, Django, Redis, Postgres, and many other technologies, Ion was developed from the ground up to be simple, well-documented, and extensible.

 Ion allows students, teachers, and staff at TJHSST to access student information, manage activity signups, and view information on news and events. [Read more about how Ion is used at Thomas Jefferson](https://ion.tjhsst.edu/about).
