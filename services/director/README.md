# Director

**Director 4.0** is a website management interface for student and activity websites. It was created during the 2019-20 school year and is currently used by many of the web application development classes.

The application was created to provide a secure, beginner friendly, and highly customizable website hosting platform. To achieve this goal, many features, including a web terminal and online editor, were implemented. The project has been completely [student-built](https://director.tjhsst.edu/about), and was the senior research project of Class of 2020 Sysadmins. Director 4.0 was the next iteration of web3, the senior research project of Eric Wang \(class of 2017\).

The contact person for Director is [the Director Lead.](../../general/sysadmins-list.md#current-leads)
