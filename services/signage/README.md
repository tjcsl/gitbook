# Signage

**Signage** refers to the set of ten electronic displays located all over the school. A "Signage" refers to a display that displays useful information maintained by the CSL across the school.

All signages (except for `cs-audlob`) have the same types of features which include:

* The schedule of the current school day.
* Ion announcements
* 8th period activities.
* A bus map
* A map of the whole school.

Signages can also showcase important announcements made by the Sysadmins or FCPS.

The current version of Signage is **Signage3**.

The core of Signage runs on Intel Compute Sticks ([official website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/compute-stick.html)) running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

The main contact for signages are our Signage Lead(s). The Intranet Lead(s) are usually the deputies for signages if the Signage Lead(s) are not present.

## History

### Signage1

The first Signage displays were installed around the first release of Ion ([source](https://tjhsst.edu/\~jwoglom/ion.pdf)) (around May 2016). They were originally developed as a complement to Ion. These efforts were led by James Woglom. The Signage displays ran on a mixture of Raspberry Pi 1s, Raspberry Pi 2s, and Raspberry Pi 3s.

### Signage2

Development of Signage2 began in April of 2017 to serve as a rewrite of Signage1 using Python's Kivy framework. Various limitations imposed by Kivy and slow performance led to the end of development around March of 2018.

### Signage 3

Development of Signage3 began in March of 2018 to serve as a rewrite of Signage as a webpage hosted on Ion. Signage3 was deployed on newly-arrived Intel Compute Sticks on April 12, 2018. Signage3 remains the current Signage deployed throughout the school.

## List

The current deployed Signage displays are named (and located):

* `cs-nobel` (Nobel commons)
* `cs-curie` (Curie commons)
* `cs-galileo` (Galileo commons)
* `cs-cafeteria` (Cafeteria)
* `cs-gandhi-a` (Ghandi commons)
* `cs-audlob` (Outside the audlob)
* `cs-library` (Library hallway)
* `cs-hopper` (Hopper commons)
* `cs-cafe` (Cafe commons)
* `cs-einstein-a` (Einstein commons)

## Current Setup

Each Signage display has their own Intel Compute Stick which runs Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS. Using getty, each Signage display logs in as `user` and opens up a specific web page on Ion (`https://ion.tjhsst.edu/signage/display/<display_name>`) in Chromium. The Signage pages can be rendered server-side or as iframes. The code for Signage can be found [here](https://github.com/tjcsl/ion/tree/master/intranet/apps/signage).
