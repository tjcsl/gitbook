# IonTap

**IonTap** is an experimental project to allow users to sign up for 8th period on the Signage displays.  The project is led by Keegan Lanzillotta.  Code for the prototype TapIn can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/keegan/TapIn).  The project would rely on issued NFC cards as identification and the touch Signage displays as kiosks.
