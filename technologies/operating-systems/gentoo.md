# Debian

Debian is a popular Linux operating system. It serves as the upstream distribution of Ubuntu and is used on all CSL workstations.

### Notable Features

* It allows you to launch Firefox. For some reason (probably related to Ubuntu/Canonical pushing their `snapd` package manager), Firefox wouldn't start on workstations after we migrated from AFS to NFS, and Mozilla's builds would get replaced by a stub for the Snap installer, which is absolutely infuriating.

### Notable CSL Modifications

* Unlike the other OSes, workstations are imaged with USBs instead of netboot.

### Trivia

* Debian releases are codenamed with Toy Story character names. The workstations use version 12, aka `bookworm`.
