# Operating Systems

The CSL currently runs two separate operating systems on its servers: Ubuntu and AlmaLinux. Workstations currently run Ubuntu, though Debian is being considered as a replacement.

The CSL used to run a multitude of other operating systems, mostly on Sun hardware. These included:

* (Sun) Solaris
* Gentoo
* FreeBSD/OpenBSD
* Whatever the [Cray SV1 ran](../../obsolete/cray-sv1-supercomputer.md)
