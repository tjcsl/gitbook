# GitLab

**GitLab** is a MIT-licensed, web-based Git repository manager that provides issue tracking, code hosting, and Continuous Integration (CI)/Continuous Development (CD). The CSL uses GitLab to host Git repositories for the sysadmins (excluding the public repositories for [GitBook](../gitbook.md), [Ion](../../../services/ion/), [Director](../../../services/director/), and [Othello](../../../services/academic-services/othello/)). The website for the developers behind GitLab can be found at [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) and the CSL's self-hosted version can be found at [gitlab.tjhsst.edu](https://gitlab.tjhsst.edu).

## History

The first installation of GitLab occured around September of 2017. All the repositories previously on the [TJCSL Github](https://github.com/tjcsl) had to be manually marked deprecated and moved to the new system. It was reinstalled after the events of the [Cephpocalypse](../../../machines/history/2018-cephpocalypse.md) during October of 2018.

## Primary Uses

* Hosting repositories (for passcard, ansible, dns, dhcp, qemuconfig, etc.)
* Providing CI pipelines for updates to [DNS](../../networking/dns.md) and [DHCP](../../networking/dhcp.md).
