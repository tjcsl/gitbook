# Moon

**Moon** is a Sun Fire V215 currently used for monitoring and lab emergency backdoor access. Moon also acts as a UPS monitoring station. It is the syslog server for all servers, workstations, and the Cisco switch. It also has the serial hardline to the CSL main switch.

This server has CSL, TJHSST-LAN, and FCPS addresses. It is very locked down compared to other CSL systems. In order to get access to Moon, you must get someone with SSH or physical access to create a user and copy your SSH keys over; there is no password login.
