## History

Agni was received as a part of the 2008 Sun Academic Excellence Grant and was originally used as an emergency access workstation running Solaris 10 \(it did not rely on Kerberos or AFS\). Later, it became the Lab's backup server running OpenSolaris. It is now being used as our primary NTP server.
