# Moloch

**Moloch** is a "midrange" Sun Enterprise 4500 server. It was received as part of the NIH donation of Sun equipment.

It was suspected that Moloch was able to outperform our [Cray SV1 Supercomputer](cray-sv1-supercomputer.md), even at supercomputing \(just about everything can outperform the Cray at non-supercomputing tasks\).

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Server Type** | Sun Enterprise 4500 |
| **CPU** | 464 MHz UltraSPARC-II |
| **RAM** | 6144 MiB |
| **Hard Disks** | None? |
| **OS** | Solaris 10 |
| **Purchase Date** |  |

## Notes

Moloch has no built-in disks or disk boards, and purchasing a disk board \(no disks\) from Sun would cost $1500. An external SCSI disk enclosure was purchased since netbooting off of [sol](sol.md) was becoming a pain.
