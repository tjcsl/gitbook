# Setup

This page describes how to set up AFS on a server. If you are looking for the client configuration, see:

{% content-ref url="client.md" %}
[client.md](client.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

TL;DR: use ansible for both clients and servers.

## Packages

On Ubuntu, the following packages are needed for it to operate.

* `openafs-modules-dkms`
* `openafs-krb5`
* `openafs-fileserver`
* `openafs-dbserver`
* `openafs-client`

## Configuration

The QEMU configuration files for the OpenAFS servers have three disks attached to each server:

* `openafs<NUMBER>` (attached as `/dev/vda`) which contains the root partition.
* `openafs<NUMBER>-vicepa` (attached as `/dev/vdb`) which contains the `vicepa` partition and is mounted as `/vicepa`.
* `openafs<NUMBER>-vicepb` (attached as `/dev/vdc`) which contains the `vicepb` partition and is mounted as `/vicepb`.

The disks themselves are stored in [Ceph](../../technologies/storage/ceph/).

The configuration files `CellServDB` and `UserList` are copied to `/etc/openafs/server`, then the following commands are run:

*   Create the **ptserver** process:

    ```
    bos create <hostname> ptserver simple /usr/lib/openafs/ptserver -localauth
    ```
*   Create the **vlserver** process:

    ```
    bos create <hostname> vlserver simple /usr/lib/openafs/vlserver -localauth
    ```
*   Create the **buserver** process:

    ```
    bos create <hostname> buserver simple /usr/lib/openafs/buserver -localauth
    ```
*   Create the **dafs** process:

    ```
    bos create <hostname> dafs dafs /usr/lib/openafs/dafileserver /usr/lib/openafs/davolserver /usr/lib/openafs/salvageserver /usr/lib/openafs/dasalvager -localauth
    ```
*   Start the backup cron job:

    ```
    bos create <hostname> dailybackup cron -cmd "/usr/bin/vos backupsys -server <hostname> -localauth" "2:00"
    ```

Note: these commands should only be run once, when creating a new OpenAFS server.

### Sample `CellServDB`

```
>csl.tjhsst.edu    #Cell name
198.38.16.19    #openafs1.csl.tjhsst.edu
198.38.16.22    #openafs2.csl.tjhsst.edu
198.38.16.23    #openafs3.csl.tjhsst.edu
198.38.16.24    #openafs4.csl.tjhsst.edu
198.38.16.25    #openafs5.csl.tjhsst.edu
```

### Sample `UserList`

Entries correspond to [Kerberos](../kerberos.md) principals of administrators who should be able to run `bos` and `vos`.

```
2019okulkarn.admin
2020fouzhins.root
```

## Automation

Like it says at the beginning, [the ansible repo on GitLab](https://gitlab.tjhsst.edu/sysadmins/ansible/blob/master/roles/openafs-server/tasks/main.yml) is the ultimate source of authority for configuring OpenAFS. This document exists to provide a summary of the `openafs-server` play in case something happens to the repo.
