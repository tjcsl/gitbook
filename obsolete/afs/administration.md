# Administration

OpenAFS is an implementation of the Andrew File System. It is used to store home directories for student and staff. There are currently five active storage servers (`openafs[1-5]`) .

Our OpenAFS cell is called `csl.tjhsst.edu`, but you can just call it `csl` when navigating to it in the AFS tree.

## Administration Concepts

As you might expect, OpenAFS is a rather complex system. It is laid out using a few main components:

* `bos`, the **B**asic **O**ver**s**eers, which essentially oversees every other server
* `pts`, the **P**ro**t**ection **S**erver, which keeps track of users and groups
* `vos`, the **Vo**lume **S**erver, which keeps track of volumes
* `fs`, which, as you might expect, is the **F**ile **S**erver.

Each of these systems has a command named after it (i.e. `vos` lets you interface with the volume server, `fs` works with the file server, and so on) to allow you to administer it.

## Servers

The CSL has quite a few AFS servers:

* [openafs1](../../machines/vm-servers/gorgona.md)
* [openafs2](../../machines/vm-servers/galapagos.md)
* [openafs3](../../machines/vm-servers/antipodes.md)
* [openafs4](../../machines/vm-servers/chatham.md)
* [openafs5](../../machines/vm-servers/cocos.md)

## Managing OpenAFS

OpenAFS has a few command-line tools that you can use in order to manage it. Before using them, gain administrative access to AFS. If you don't, you won't be able to make changes.

```
kinit 2016fwilson/admin
    Password for 2016fwilson/admin@CSL.TJHSST.EDU:
aklog
```

Once you've done this, if your `/admin` principal is in the AFS group `system:administrators`, you will have administrative access to AFS.

## `bos` (Basic Overseer)

`bos` manages everything. Hopefully, you won't have to deal with it much. If something breaks, `bos help` is a great resource. The one common use case for `bos` is if a volume suddenly goes offline. If this happens, it may need to be "salvaged." This can be done with the following command:

```bash
bos salvage <SERVER> <PARTITION> <VOLUME> -forceDAFS
```

If you have server-wide corruption (which is bad), you can attempt to salvage volumes with:

```bash
bos salvage <SERVER> <PARTITION> -all -forceDAFS
```

## `vos` (Volume Server)

AFS has a concept of volumes. A volume is simply a logical container for files. It differs from a directory in that it can be mounted anywhere in the AFS tree, and can be moved from server to server as needed.

To create a new volume:

```bash
vos create <SERVER> <PARTITION> <VOLUME>
```

After creating a volume, you will probably want to set the quota. See the section on [Quotas](administration.md#quotas) below. You will probably also want to mount the volume somewhere, so you can actually use it. See the section on [Volume Mountpoints](administration.md#volume-mountpoints) below.

You can examine volumes with the `examine` sub-command:

```bash
vos examine 2016.2016fwilson

2016.2016fwilson                  536910165 RW     875423 K  On-line
...
number of sites -> 1
   server openafs4.csl.tjhsst.edu partition /vicepa RW Site
```

Another common operation is listing volumes. This can be done by referring to the VLDB (volume database)

```bash
vos listvldb
```

Or, if you want to query the server directly, you can do that as well:

```bash
vos listvol openafs4
```

You can restrict listings to a specific partition as well.

When a partition on a server is running out of space, you may want to move volumes to another server or partition. This can be done with the `move` sub-command:

```bash
$ vos move <VOLUME> <OLD_SERVER> <OLD_PARTITION> <NEW_SERVER> <NEW_PARTITION>
```

This might take a while, and progress isn't printed. Be patient! If you don't know which volumes to move, this obscure command can print out the largest ones:

```bash
vos listvol server partition | tr -s " " | tail -n +2 | head -n -3 | grep -v "\.backup" | sort -g -k 4 -r | cut -d' ' -f1,4 | less
```

You can also take volumes offline, or restore them, with the `offline` and `online` sub-commands:

```bash
vos offline 2016.2016fwilson
vos online 2016.2016fwilson
```

If a volume can't come online, it may need to be salvaged.

## `fs` (File Server)

### Permissions

AFS completely ignores standard UNIX permissions. **That means that** `chmod` **will do absolutely nothing for you**. Instead, AFS uses its own permission system, which can only apply to an entire directory at a time, instead of just a single file. This means that you may have to find clever workarounds to some problems. As an AFS admin, you'll be able to modify permissions anywhere in the tree. Here's how you can do that:

```bash
cd /afs/csl/some/directory
fs la .

... some output ...

fs sa . <USER> <PERMISSIONS>
```

Or just:

```bash
fs sa <DIRECTORY> <USER> <PERMISSIONS>
```

`la` is an abbreviation for "list access list/ACL", and `sa` is an abbreviation for "set access list/ACL."

The `PERMISSIONS` you can grant a user are as follows:

* `r`: read files in the directory, but not list them
* `l`: list files in the directory, but not read them
* `i`: create new files (insert) in the directory (does not imply read/write after the files are created)
* `d`: delete files in the directory
* `k`: set locks on files
* `w`: write to files in the directory
* `a`: set permissions on files in the directory
* `read`: an alias for `rl`
* `write`: an alias for `rlidkw`
* `all`: an alias for `rlidkwa`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Permissions do not automatically extend to sub-directories within a mountpoint that were created before the  permission grant
{% endhint %}

### Quotas

AFS volumes have quotas (i.e. storage limits). The two major operations involved are examining quotas and setting quotas. First, `cd` to the directory where the volume in question is mounted:

```bash
cd /afs/csl/students/2016/2016fwilson
```

To show the quota, use the `lq` subcommand (short for "list quota"):

```bash
fs lq
Volume Name                    Quota       Used %Used   Partition
2016.2016fwilson             4194304     875423   21%          2%
```

To set the quota, use the `sq` command (short for "set quota"):

```bash
fs sq . 4194304
```

You can also set the quota for a volume upon volume creation with `-maxquota`

`fs lq` will reflect this change. Note that the quota value you specify must be in kilobytes.

### Volume Mount-points

Volumes can be mounted anywhere in the AFS tree. To manage volume mount-points, there are two primary commands.

In order to mount a volume at a point in the tree, use the `mkmount` sub-command:

```bash
fs mkmount /afs/csl/web/user/2016fwilson 2016.2016fwilson
```

To remove a mount-point:

```bash
fs rmmount /afs/csl/web/user/2016fwilson
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
When creating a mount-point, the target directory should not already exist
{% endhint %}

### Cache

Rarely, the AFS cache will act up on a specific machine. This problem may manifest itself in the form of an empty directory, for example. Fortunately, fixing it isn't that difficult.

If you're feeling lazy:

```bash
fs flushall
```

You can also target a specific directory:

```bash
fs flush /afs/csl/web/www
```

...or a specific volume:

```bash
fs flushvolume 2016.2016fwilson
```

## pts (Projection Server)

The Protection Server keeps track of users and groups. By the way, it always assigns negative IDs to groups and positive IDs to users.

Help on all `pts` commands can be found with the `pts help` sub-command.

### Groups

AFS has a concept of groups. As an AFS admin, you can manage all existing groups (including `system:administrators`), and create new ones.

You can inspect an existing group by using the `examine` sub-command:

```bash
pts examine system:administrators

... some information about the group ...
```

You can view the members of a group by using the membership sub-command:

```bash
pts membership system:administrators

...
2016fwilson.admin
...
```

You can also view which groups a user is a member of using the same command.

```bash
pts membership 2016fwilson

...
2016fwilson.conductor
web.admin
csl-research-6
...
```

Adding users to groups can be done using the `adduser` sub-command:

```bash
pts adduser <USER> <GROUP>
```

For example,

```bash
pts adduser 2016jwoglom.admin system:administrators
```

The inverse action, removing users from groups, uses the `removeuser` sub-command:

```bash
pts removeuser <USERNAME> <GROUP>
```

For example,

```bash
pts removeuser 2016jwoglom.admin system:administrators
```

Creating groups can be done with the `creategroup` sub-command:

```bash
pts creategroup <GROUP>
```

For example,

```bash
pts creategroup a-group
```

### Users

AFS users are separate from [Kerberos/LDAP ](../kerberos.md)users, and as such, must be created separately. This can be done with the `createuser` sub-command:

```bash
pts createuser <USERNAME>
```

You can examine a user with the examine sub-command:

```bash
pts examine <USERNAME>
```
