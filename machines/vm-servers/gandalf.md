## History

Gandalf was previously named auckland (and before 2017-18 gandalf) and was one of three servers running VMware ESXi used to host JCIRN.

In 2017-2018, Gandalf was used to run the official TJHSST Othello Tournament.

Gandalf was the first physical server to run Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.&#x20;

Due to the [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19\_pandemic) pandemic, Ubuntu 20.04 was installed on this server 100% remotely.
