# ASM

**ASM** is a machine residing in the CSL pit, right outside the machine room. It is currently being used by 2019jduvall to conduct senior research. Older brother of [Duke](duke.md)

## History

ASM was originally part of the i7 cluster, made up of other machines named after other programming languages. At the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year, ASM was repurposed by 2017wzhang to be his personal workstation \(at school\). By the end of the 2017-2018, only ASM remained in the CSL as all the other gutted motherboards of the i7 cluster had been taken home by other sysadmins.

During the [Cephpocalypse](../history/2018-cephpocalypse.md), ASM was used as a place to put exported Ceph images, largely due to its fast \(~10MB/s\) uplink, ease of logging in as root, and large hard drive size. People were outraged when 2019jduvall accidentally cut ssh access to it in the middle of the crisis \(I'm sorry, ok?\).

## Trivia

* ASM is currently the only computer in the CSL running Arch Linux \(besides a majority of Sysadmin personal laptops\)
* Despite having two GPUs, the pioneer workstations can occasionally outperform it simply due to having newer GPUs
* It is completely and utterly wrong to write ASM's name in lowercase text
