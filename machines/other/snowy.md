# Snowy

The second-most powerful machine in the lab, after unicron. [Duke](duke.md) and [ASM](asm.md) are little babies compared to this bad boy.

## History

Snowy was a purchase order as part of Arya Kumar's 2019 Senior Research project. He went through a bunch of different names as the case kept getting delayed in the mail, eventually arriving 3 months late.

Snowy is currently sitting on the floor by the Sun and HPC racks. Its ethernet cable comes from the Sun Rack and power is a mess.

## Trivia

* Snowy was supposed to have 4x NVIDIA RTX 2080, but there wasn't enough room in the case; the fans on the bottom take up too much space.
* After completing the build, someone posted a picture of it to [https://old.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace](https://old.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace). It quickly amassed 12.3k upvotes.
* Snowy originally had three RTX 2080s. The middle one got too hot sometimes and thermal throttled. It ultimately caught fire in 2021. Now there are only two RTX 2080s.
* Nearly everything in the case has RGB LEDs on it, except for the CPU.
* The Cluster lead wanted the Ethernet port information to be put here.
