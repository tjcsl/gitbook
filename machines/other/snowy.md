# Snowy

_THE_ single most powerful machine in the lab. Probably even outpaces the [Cluster](../../services/cluster/) simply because GPU and the Cluster is broken half the time. [Duke](duke.md) and [ASM](asm.md) are little babies compared to this bad boy.

## Technical specifications

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Server Type** | It's a desktop \(a documentation writer's worst nightmare\) |
| **CPU** | AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X 16-Core Processor |
| **RAM** | 64 GB |
| **GPU** | 3x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 |
| **Hard Disks** | 1TB SSD |
| **OS** | Ubuntu Desktop 18.04 LTS |

## History

Snowy was a purchase order as part of Arya Kumar's 2019 Senior Research project. He went through a bunch of different names as the case kept getting delayed in the mail, eventually arriving 3 months late.

Snowy is currently sitting in the HPC rack on top of the HPC nodes. Its ethernet cable comes from the Sun Rack and power is a mess.

## Trivia

* Snowy was supposed to have 4x NVIDIA RTX 2080, but there wasn't enough room in the case; the fans on the bottom take up too much space.
* After completing the build, someone posted a picture of it to [https://old.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace](https://old.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace). It quickly amassed 12.3k upvotes.
* The middle RTX 2080 gets too hot sometimes and thermal throttles. Even with the blower style cards.
* Nearly everything in the case has RGB LEDs on it, except for the CPU.
