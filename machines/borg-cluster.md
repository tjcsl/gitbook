# Borg Cluster

Acquired as a gift by NASA, the **Borg Cluster** is our second high performance computing cluster. It consists of 40 nodes, labeled `borgw2[01-40]`, the first 12 of which are currently plugged in \(the power draw would be too large for our outlets\).

## Technical Specifications

Every node in the cluster has the same specifications:

| **Specification** | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Server Type** | IBM dx360 M4 |
| **CPU** | Intel\(R\) Xeon\(R\) E5-2670 @ 2.60GHz |
| **RAM** | 32 GB |
| **Hard Disks** | 500GB |
| **OS** | CentOS 7 |
| **Purchase Date** | 2017 |

## Trivia

Every node in the borg cluster is named after a constellation. This makes all them really, really hard to remember \(even harder than the [HPC Cluster](hpc-cluster/) names!\) except for by their number.
