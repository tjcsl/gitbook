# Mathematica

## What is Mathematica?

[Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) is the world's most powerful global computing environment. Ideal for use in engineering, mathematics, finance, physics, chemistry, biology, and a wide range of other fields, it makes possible a new level of automation in algorithmic computation, interactive manipulation, and dynamic presentation--as well as a whole new way of interacting with the world of data.

## Installing Mathematica at home

To install Mathematica on a personally-owned machine, please use the following instructions

{% hint style="info" %}
These instructions require that you create a Wolfram Account using your TJ email address using [this link](https://user.wolfram.com/portal/registration.html).
{% endhint %}

1. Visit [this link](https://user.wolfram.com/portal/requestAK/0a05e6568a881b476bd5ea15444b100ff94cdd2e), sign in with your Wolfram Account, and fill out the form to request an activation key.
2. After you submit the form, your activation key will be displayed and will also be sent to your TJ email.
3. To download the installers for Mathematica, follow the link on either the activation key page or in the email with your activation key.
4. Download the appropriate installer for your platform (Windows, OS X, or Linux) and install it as you would any other application for your platform.
5. After you launch Mathematica, you will be prompted to enter the activation key you received and accept the Mathematica EULA.
