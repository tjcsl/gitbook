# Matlab

## What is Matlab?

[Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is a high-performance language used for technical computing. It combines a desktop environment tuned for iterative analysis and design processes with a programming language that expresses matrix and array mathematics directly. It includes a [Live Editor](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) for creating scripts that combine code, output, and formatted text in an executable notebook.
