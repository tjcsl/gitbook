# Resetting Your Ion Password

{% hint style="info" %}
For students, your Ion username consists of your graduation year, followed by your first initial, followed by your last name up to seven letters. If your last name is longer that seven letters, the remainder gets cut off. For instance, John Schinder - a student scheduled to graduate in 2016 - would have the username 2016jschinde.\
\
For staff, your Ion usernames are identical to your FCPS usernames.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Whenever you are prompted to sign into a Google account throughout this process, you MUST use your \<student-id>@fcpsschools.net address as a student or your @fcps.edu account if you are a staff member.
{% endhint %}

### Resetting Your Password

1. Browse to [https://resetter.tjhsst.edu](https://resetter.tjhsst.edu).
2. Log in with your FCPS Google account.
3. Follow the prompts to reset your password.

### Possible Errors

If you see a page that informs you that you have an invalid Google login, one of two situations are possible:

1. If you attempt to authenticate with a Google account that is not your FCPS account, you will get a message like the one above. Please log in with your FCPS Google account.
2. It is possible that your account has not fully been created. You will see a page indicating Please email [accounts@tjhsst.edu](mailto:accounts@tjhsst.edu) with your FCPS Student ID and TJ username. If you don't know either, just include your first and last name and your graduation year.

If you encounter any other issues, please email [accounts@tjhsst.edu](mailto:accounts@tjhsst.edu).
