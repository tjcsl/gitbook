# Using a 3rd Party Client

## IMAP

You will need to use the following settings for IMAP (sometimes called incoming mail) and SMTP (sometimes called outgoing mail):

* IMAP
  * Server: imap.tjhsst.edu
  * Port: 993
  * Encryption Type: SSL
  * Username / Password: TJ Username and Password
* SMTP
  * Server: smtp.tjhsst.edu
  * Port: 465
  * Encryption Type: SSL
  * Requires Auth: YES
  * Username / Password: TJ Username and Password

## POP3

Some clients do not support IMAP, but only support the older POP3 protocol. We do not support those clients, and we recommend you use an IMAP-capable client.
